I have developed an application using Electron and Node.js, aiming to provide a seamless desktop experience for my users. While the app’s user interface and features function as expected, I have encountered a persistent and frustrating issue related to keyboard input. Specifically, there are instances where, after navigating through various menus or interacting with different parts of the app, I suddenly lose the ability to type in any of the text input fields. Although I can still click on buttons and interact with other UI elements, the keyboard becomes unresponsive within the app’s input areas. The only temporary solution I have found is to close and reopen the application, which restores typing functionality until the problem recurs.

Interestingly, this issue does not occur when I run the same code in a standard web browser; it only manifests after packaging the app with Electron. This suggests that the problem is likely related to how Electron handles focus, keyboard events, or overlays, rather than a fundamental flaw in the application’s logic. I suspect that global event listeners, focus management, or invisible overlays might be interfering with normal keyboard input. To resolve this, I plan to review my event handling code, inspect the DOM for hidden elements, and use Electron’s DevTools to debug focus and keyboard events. By systematically addressing these potential causes, I hope to eliminate this disruptive bug and ensure a smooth user experience in my
